Echo Cancellation Using Adaptive Algorithms

An adaptive algorithm is an algorithm that changes its behavior at the time it is run, based on information available and on a priori defined reward mechanism. An adaptive filter is a filter that self-adjusts its transfer function according to an optimization algorithm driven by an error signal. Adaptive filter finds its essence in applications such as echo cancellation, system identification and many others.

An acoustic echo is one of the simplest acoustic modelling problems. It happens when the direct signal follows multipath propagation.There are numerous adaptive algorithms used in an adaptive filter, out of which LMS (Least Mean Square) Algorithm, NLMS (Normalized Least Mean Square) Algorithm, RLS (Recursive Least  Square) Algorithm are prominent and widely used for echo cancellation. Adaptive filters consist of two parts. The first part is to filter the echo signal. An adaptive algorithm represent the other part and its purpose is to update the filter one at a time.
